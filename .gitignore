# User secrets (if used locally)
# This is usually appsettings.Development.json if it contains sensitive data,
# but typically appsettings.Development.json is safe to commit if it only has local dev config.
# If you use dotnet user-secrets, they are stored outside the project.
# You might exclude specific appsettings files if they contain production secrets NOT handled by Azure App Settings.
# For example, if you had a file specifically for local secrets:
# appsettings.LocalSecrets.json

# logs/
